## Hobbies
In my spare time, I like to work on my small projects to express my ideas and expand my knowledge. This ranges from a toy renderer to small games. I enjoyed playing my piano, bass, guitar and sing-along on my favorite tunes. During summer, I love to spend time outside, playing football, travelling and go for a hike. I love reading and the library full of physical books is one of my favorite places in town.
